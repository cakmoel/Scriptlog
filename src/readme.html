<h1>Welcome to Scriptlog</h1>
<b>Your personal blogware platform!</b>

<p>Scriptlog is a free and an open source PHP blog software. We're refactoring our legacy weblog code. 
Making it more simple, secure, modular, fast and robust personal blogging system. 
Scriptlog runs on PHP 7.2 or higher and uses MySQL.</p>

<p>Scriptlog's base original code was forked from 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pilus/">Piluscart 1.4.1</a>. We took her out from her weblog engine 
that support blog functionality on Piluscart 1.4.1. Obviously Scriptlog is Piluscart's little sister. 
She was being refactored to help her siblings going further on next generation of Piluscart development which is undefined yet.</p>

<p>Scriptlog is <i>not</i> a replacement for a full Content Management System. 
Do not plan on building the next CMS Framework with it! 
However, it is meticulously engineered for several reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>To power parts of weblog or personal website that did not need a full CMS.</li>
<li>Runs small scripts and systems without a lot of overhead.</li>
<li>Provides a base speed for your personal weblog day to day.</li>
<li>To provide a secure foundation for your blog.</li>
<li>Emphasizing simplicity, privacy and security for blog software.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you install Scriptlog on your host, make sure Scriptlog can work correctly in your
environment. Scritplog need the following 
<b><i>system requirement.</i></b></p>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Apache with mod_rewrite enabled (.htaccess files) or nginx (rewrite configuration covered in Documentation)</li>
<li>A minimum of 32MB of memory allocated to PHP</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> version 5.5 or greater 
    or any version of <a href="https://mariadb.org">MariaDB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://secure.php.net">PHP</a> version 7.2 or greater is recommended</li>
<li>PDO</li>
<li>mysqli</li>
<li>mysqlnd</li>
<li>curl</li>
<li>Gd</li>
<li>iconv</li>
<li>fileinfo</li>
<li>mbstring</li>
<li>exif</li>
<li>filter_list</li>
<li>zip</li>
<li>HTTPS Support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation:</h2>

<b>1) Download <a href="https://scriptlog.my.id/">Scriptlog</a></b>
<p>Every release of Scriptlog is available for download, whether the current stable release, 
upcoming test-builds, or previous versions for historical intererst. 
When you visit the download page you will find a link to each of the two main editions.</p>

<p><em>Stable releases</em> of Scriptlog are intended to be used by general public, 
so these would be the appropriate choice for the majority of users. The current Scriptlog release
can always be downloaded from the  
<a href="https://scriptlog.my.id/get-scriptlog/">Get Scriptlog</a> page.<br />
Older stable releases can also be downloaded from the Stable Release section of the 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/scriptlog/files/release/">Sourceforge website.</a>
</p>

<p><em>Test builds</em> of Scriptlog are intended to be used by developers 
and testers to identify any bugs or issues during the development process.
These are not suitable for use as a main blogging system by the general public.
However, should you wish to try out a test build(preverably in local webhost), 
each current release of the Test Builds can be downloaded on
<a href="https://github.com/cakmoel/Scriptlog">Scriptlog's repository.</a></p>

<b>2) Ensure you have the required system.</b>
<p>if you have <i>not</i> the required system yet, 
Scriptlog may <i>not</i> work properly in your host environment.</p>

<b>3) Unzip the package downloaded</b>
<p>Extract it in an empty directory. You will see the following files, folders or directories after you extract it

<ul>
<li>admin/</li>
<li>install/</li>
<li>lib/</li>
<li>public/</li>
<li>config.sample.php</li>
<li>.htaccess</li>
<li>index.php</li>
<li>license.txt</li>
<li>readme.html</li>                
</ul>
                
</p>

<b>4) Upload Scriptlog</b>
<p>Upload all files, folders or directories above through FTP/SFTP or whatever upload method 
you prefer to the public-facing directory of your site.</p>

<b>5) Ensure that permission for :</b>
<p><em>install</em>, <em>public/log</em>, <em>public/cache</em>, <em>public/themes</em> 
and <em>library/plugins</em> folders are set to <em>writeable</em> 
and that all files belong to the web user or is a part of the same group as the web user.</p>

<b>6) Create database for Scriptlog</b>
<p>You may name it anything you like. Choose <em>utf8mb4_general_ci</em> as it <b>collation</b>. 
The method for database creation varies depending on your webhost but may require using adminer, PHPMyAdmin or etc. 
If you are unsure how to createt this, ask your host.</p>

<b>7) Follow the installation procedure</b>
<p>Open <em>install/</em> in your browser. You will be asked to fill each column provided. 
You should enter all database connection details and administrator account.
These informations will help you through process to set up a <em>config.php</em> file.</p>

<p>if some reason this does not work, don't worry. Open up <em>config.sample.php</em> with text editor  
and change the following line:</p>
<code>
  return [

    'db' => [
        
         'host' => 'hostname', # database's hostname
         'user' => 'username', # database's username
         'pass' => 'password', # database's password
         'name' => 'dbname'    # database's name

      ],

    'app' => [

         'url'   => 'http://yourservername',  # your server-name
         'email' => 'email address',          # administrator's email 
         'key'   => 'application key'         # optional
     ]

  ];

</code>

<p>fill in your database connection details, your server name and administrator's email.<br>
Save the file as <em>config.php</em> and upload it.</p>

<p>Open <em>install/</em> in your browser. Once the configuration file is set up, 
the installer will set up the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, 
double-check your <em>config.php</em> file, and try again. </p>


<b>8) Remove the installation directory</b>
<p>For security purpose, delete the <em>install</em> folder when you are finish.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>After you finish installation, you can populate your blog. To manage your blog content, go to
administrator panel on web browser: <em>http://your-server-name/admin/</em>.
</p>


<h2>How the System Works</h2>

When a request is sent to the folder where Scriptlog resides, 
the .htaccess file will send the request to <em>index.php</em> as <em>front-controller</em>. 
The index will load the main engine files in "library" and
then checks to see if a "cached" version of the page already exists. 
If not, then it will continue to load the core system files.</p>

<p>After this, it will check with <em>dispatcher</em> 
to figure out what route and rules to call. </p>

<ol>
<li>If a route requested mattching the URL is found in <em>rules</em>, then the method given 
(either in the URL or config) is run and the output is returned.</li>

<li>If a route requested is <i>not</i> found, then it will trigger a 404 error as the output.</li>
</ol>

<p>The output (whether an error or not) is then placed in the current theme and the final content is
sent to the users browser</p>
